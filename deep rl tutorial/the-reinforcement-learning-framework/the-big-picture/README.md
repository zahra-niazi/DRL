# The Big Picture

The idea behind Reinforcement Learning is that an agent (an AI) will learn from the environment by **interacting with it** (through trial and error) and **receiving rewards** (negative or positive) as feedback for performing actions.

## Formal definitions

> “Reinforcement learning provides a mathematical formalism for learning-based decision making”

> Reinforcement learning is an approach for learning decision making and control from experience

> Reinforcement learning is a framework for solving control tasks (also **called decision problems) by building agents that learn from the environment by interacting with it through trial and error and** receiving rewards (positive or negative) as unique feedback.
