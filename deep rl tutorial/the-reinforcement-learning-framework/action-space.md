# Action Space

The Action space is the set of all possible actions in an environment.

The actions can come from a _discrete_ or _continuous space_:

## _**Discrete space**_

> The number of possible actions is finite.

In Super Mario Bros, we have a finite set of actions since we have only 5 possible actions: 4 directions and jump.

## _**Continuous space**_

> The number of possible actions is infinite.
