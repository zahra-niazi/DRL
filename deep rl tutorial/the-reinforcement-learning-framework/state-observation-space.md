# State/Observation Space

Observations/States are the information our agent gets from the environment. In the case of a video game, it can be a frame (a screenshot). In the case of the trading agent, it can be the value of a certain stock, etc.

There is a differentiation to make between _observation_ and _state_, however:

### _**State s:**_

> is **a complete description of the state of the world** (there is no hidden information). In a fully observed environment.

In a chess game, we have access to the whole board information, so we receive a state from the environment. In other words, the environment is fully observed.

### _**Observation o:**_

> is a **partial description of the state**. In a partially observed environment

In Super Mario Bros, we only see the part of the level close to the player, so we receive an observation. In Super Mario Bros, we are in a partially observed environment. We receive an observation since we only see a part of the level.
