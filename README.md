# Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repository combines a tutorial on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a detailed report on the implementation and ideas presented in the article "Stabilizing Deep Q-Learning with ConvNets under Data Augmentation."

## Tutorial

In the tutorial section, you will find a step-by-step guide to understanding the fundamental concepts of DRL. The gitbook can be found [here](https://zns-notes.gitbook.io/deep-reinforcement-learning/).

## Implementation Report

The implementation report is based on the article ["Stabilizing Deep Q-Learning with ConvNets under Data Augmentation."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00644) This report provides an analysis of the ideas presented in the article, along with some suggestions for improvement.
